# Covid_DataAnalystPortfolioProject

## Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in unprecedented ways, with millions of cases and fatalities reported worldwide. The project aims to explore COVID-19 data using various data analysis techniques in SQL to identify trends, patterns, and insights.

## Data Source:
The data used for this project was sourced from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The data contains daily updates of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide from January 22, 2020, to the present.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL
- Tableau

## Data Collection and Cleaning:
The data was downloaded in CSV format from the CSSE GitHub repository and loaded into a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench. The data was then cleaned using SQL queries to remove null values and inconsistencies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The cleaned data was explored using SQL queries to identify trends and patterns in the data such as the daily increase in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Geospatial Analysis:
Geospatial analysis was performed using SQL queries to aggregate the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and plot them on a world map to visualize the impact of the pandemic globally.

## Time Series Analysis:
Time series analysis was performed using SQL queries to forecast the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries for the coming days using different models such as ARIMA.

## Data Visualization:
Interactive dashboards were created using Tableau to visualize the trends, patterns, and insights obtained from the data analysis.

## Conclusion:
The COVID-19 Data Exploration project in SQL provides insights into the trends and patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic using data analysis techniques. The project showcases proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using SQL and Tableau. The project can be used as a reference for future data exploration projects and provides insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
