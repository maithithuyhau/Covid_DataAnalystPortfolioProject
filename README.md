# Covid_DataAnalystPortfolioProject

## Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in unprecedented ways, with millions of cases and fatalities reported worldwide. The project aims to explore COVID-19 data using various data analysis techniques in SQL to identify trends, patterns, and insights.

## Data Source:
The data used for this project was sourced from Our World in Data, which provides comprehensive data on COVID-19 deaths worldwide from January 2020 to the present. The data is updated regularly and can be downloaded in CSV format.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL
- Tableau

## Data Collection and Cleaning:
The data was downloaded in CSV format from the CSSE GitHub repository and loaded into a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench. The data was then cleaned using SQL queries to remove null values and inconsistencies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The cleaned data was explored using SQL queries to identify trends and patterns in the data such as the daily increase in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Geospatial Analysis:
Geospatial analysis was performed using SQL queries to aggregate the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and plot them on a world map to visualize the impact of the pandemic globally.

## Time Series Analysis:
Time series analysis was performed using SQL queries to forecast the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries for the coming days using different models such as ARIMA.

## Data Visualization:
Interactive dashboards were created using Tableau to visualize the trends, patterns, and insights obtained from the data analysis.

## Conclusion:
The COVID-19 Data Exploration project in SQL provides insights into the trends and patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic using data analysis techniques. The project showcases proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using SQL and Tableau. The project can be used as a reference for future data exploration projects and provides insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
